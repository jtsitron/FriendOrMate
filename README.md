# FriendOrMate



What can we learn from a twitter @handle?

The user's location, for one thing!

The most notable difference between British and American English is the vocabulary.

For example, Brits call the front of a car the bonnet, while Americans call it the hood.

FriendOrMate is a classifier built using Natural Language Processing to learn these subtle differences from tweets.

It then uses its training to predict where a brand new tweet originates: the US or the UK.
